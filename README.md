# Stable EFI for Acer A515-51G Hackitosh using Opencore 0.6.4

### Worked great on:
* MacOS Catalina 10.15.7
* MacOS BigSur 11.0.x
* MacOS BigSur 11.1.x

### Note:
* Catalina ver has much higher performance than Bigsur ver.
* Audio at jack 3.5 works stably with **alcid=11** (Realtek ALC255)
* To auto enable second monitor after login, set **igfxonln=1**

### Hehe:
